## Testing

We maintain high test coverage. Please add tests for any new features or bug fixes.

### Test Structure

* Unit tests go in `test/unit/`
* Integration tests go in `test/integration/`
* Each feature should have its own test file
* Test files should mirror the structure of `lib/`

### Writing Tests

```dart
void main() {
  group('Feature Name', () {
    test('should do something', () {
      // Arrange
      final sut = SystemUnderTest();
      
      // Act
      final result = sut.doSomething();
      
      // Assert
      expect(result, equals(expectedValue));
    });
  });
}
```

## Documentation

* Document all public APIs
* Use examples in documentation
* Keep README.md up to date
